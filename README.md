# Bitcoin_Arbitrage_Analysis

Use case: Traders use arbitrage to exploit price differences between markets. If there are significant price differences, a trader could buy at a lower price from one exchange and sell at a higher price to another exchange. In this analysis, I will harvest data using Quandl API and load it in Jupyter notebook for further analysis with Python.

Objective: assess if there is a price difference between exchanges and which exchanges offer the best arbitrage opportunity.

Limitations: In this demonstration, I will focus only on the price of bitcoin (BTC) from 3 different exchanges: Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitflyer for the year 2020.
